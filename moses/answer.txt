HELLO WE GOT THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE FROM ONE OF OUR SPIES
BUT SHE COULD NOT SPACE BETWEEN LETTERS AND WORDS
WE KNOW SHE WAS TRYING TO SEND A SEQUENCE OF WORDS AS THEY APPEAR IN THIS BOOK
HELP US FIND THE SEQUENCE UNFORTUNATELLY
SOME OF TONES WERE NOT CLEAR SO WE REPLACED THEM WITH X BECAUSE WE WERE NOT SURE IF IT WAS A DOT OR A LINE
----------------------------------------
x.xx...x.xxx..-xx-.xxxx.-.-xxx.-.x..x.xxxx..x.xxx.-.-.xx-.-xxx..-.xx.x.x.--x.xxx
----------------------------------------
THE FLAG IS THE SEQUENCE SEPARATED BY UNDERSCORES INSIDE CURLY BRACKETS AFTER UPPERCASE CSA
