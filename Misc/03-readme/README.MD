**Solution:**

the story has convertet to 1337 speak, and the old flag as well:

`{hey_that_is_the_great_puzzle}`

we need to make a map between every letter of the flag to 1337 speak (based on the file)

then check every possible option (2570 millions) with the key_checker_data

`CSA{hEY_th@T_l5_thE_9RE4T_p[ZZL3}`
